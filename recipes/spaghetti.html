        <h3>Ingredients (6 servings):</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 package of 500 g Barilla spaghetti nº 3</li>
            <li>1 tray of cherry tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 whole head of garlic</li>
            <li>Quality olive oil (enough to cover the bottom of the pan)</li>
            <li>Chopped olives (optional)</li>
            <li>Salt and black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 bunch of fresh basil</li>
            <li>A dash of oil</li>
            <li>50 g of grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>Instructions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Wash the cherry tomatoes, basil, and olives (if using).</li>
            <li>Slice the olives into small rounds and halve the cherry tomatoes; set aside.</li>
            <li>Boil 2 liters of water in a large pot.</li>
            <li>Add a tablespoon of salt and a dash of oil to the boiling water to prevent the pasta from sticking.</li>
            <li>While the water is boiling, microwave the whole head of garlic for 30 seconds (this helps peel the cloves more easily).</li>
            <li>Tip: Be careful when removing the garlic from the microwave, it will be hot. Wait a few seconds and make a small cut on the skin of each garlic clove; the skin will come off easily, saving time.</li>
            <li>Chop the garlic and set aside.</li>
            <li>Cook the spaghetti in the boiling water for approximately 5 minutes to be al dente (cook for 7 minutes if you prefer it more done).</li>
            <li>While the spaghetti cooks, heat a large frying pan.</li>
            <li>Add the olive oil and garlic to the pan for about 2 minutes (do not let the garlic brown as it will make the dish bitter).</li>
            <li>Add the cherry tomatoes and olives, and sauté for 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
            <li>Drain the pasta and add it to the frying pan.</li>
            <li>Add the basil leaves and grated cheese.</li>
            <li>Stir for 2 minutes to absorb the flavors and serve hot.</li>
        </ol>
